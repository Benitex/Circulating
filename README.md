# Circulating

Circulating is a simple game currently in development, made using Lua and Love2d. Available on desktop and mobile devices.

## Game description

The player's goal is to escape from the circle that follows the mouse, which gets faster and bigger every second.

Also, players can change the difficulty through a store, which offers items that can make the game easier or harder, depending on the choice. Making the game harder generates more points, which can be used to buy new items from the store.

Items in the store range from mouse and circle attributes to new game elements, such as coins that add more points and must be picked up as the player runs away from the circle.

## Credits
